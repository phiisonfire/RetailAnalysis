# Retail Analysis

In this project, I used many techniques in data science to apply to a real retail dataset to help better understand the business and customers, making suggestions to increase sales.


## EDA
-	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis using multiple libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. in Python to get better understand of the business.
## Basket Analysis
- Applied Association Rules in Data Mining to determine which products would most likely be purchased together for marketing and sales strategy purposes.
## Customer Segmentation
-	Created an RFM model based on transaction information to segment customers.
